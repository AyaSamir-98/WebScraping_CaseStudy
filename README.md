# Advanced Pandas: Data Importing & Web Scraping

This Python project showcases advanced techniques for importing data from websites using web scraping and handling it with Pandas.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup (`bs4`) and `urllib` for web scraping. Specifically, it scrapes job listings from the [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net) website and stores them in a CSV file. Then, it imports this data into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

## Importing Libraries & Methods

To accomplish this, we utilize the following libraries and methods:

- `BeautifulSoup` (bs4) for parsing HTML.
- `urllib` for handling web requests.
- `Pandas` for data analysis and manipulation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Modify the `url` variable in the code to specify the target web page you want to scrape.

3. Execute the Python script.

The script will create a CSV file named `wuzzf-illustrator.csv` and save the scraped job data in it.

## Data Scraping

The process of data scraping involves these key steps:

1. Create a client-based request to access the URL.

2. Retrieve the HTML code of the full web page.

3. Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.

4. Locate and extract the desired content within specific containers.

5. Organize and structure the extracted data.

## Importing Data into Pandas

After running the script, you can load the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
wuzzf = pd.read_csv("wuzzf-illustrator.csv")
wuzzf.info()

After running the script, you can load the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
wuzzf = pd.read_csv("wuzzf-illustrator.csv")
wuzzf.info()

Now, you can explore, analyze, and visualize the scraped job listing data using Pandas and other data analysis libraries.


##Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

    BeautifulSoup (bs4)
    urllib

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install beautifulsoup4
